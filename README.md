- "John successfully completed all Documentum developer knowledge transfer sessions."
- "John has finished viewing the full series of Documentum developer knowledge transfer trainings."
- "John participated in and completed all sessions of the Documentum developer knowledge transfer program."

Would you like this tailored for a résumé, LinkedIn profile, or professional bio?
